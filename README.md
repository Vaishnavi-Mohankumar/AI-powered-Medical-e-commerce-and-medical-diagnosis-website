# AI-powered-Medical-e-commerce-and-medical-diagnosis-website
A unified, open-source AI platform transforming healthcare access through intelligent diagnosis, medical report/image analysis, OCR prescription reading, voice-enabled chatbot, smart medicine recommendations and autonomous drone delivery. Built with scalable cloud &amp; edge architecture using React, Node.js, Python, TensorFlow, and DroneKit.

It aims to bridge the healthcare accessibility gap by integrating advanced AI tools, remote diagnostics, and delivery mechanisms into a single, unified solution. The system is designed to benefit users across urban and rural regions, offering critical support even in low-connectivity or infrastructure-deficient environments.

At its core, the solution features an intelligent symptom checker powered by generative AI, enabling users to input their health issues and receive preliminary diagnostic insights. The platform also supports analysis of medical reports and diagnostic images such as X-rays and CT scans, using trained deep learning models to extract and explain key findings in simple language. These features empower users to better understand their health data without requiring constant medical supervision.

A standout feature is the OCR-based prescription reader, which accurately reads and processes handwritten prescriptions using computer vision and NLP. This connects with the Smart Medicine Recommender to suggest suitable medicines, including cost-effective alternatives. A voice-enabled chatbot, built on large language models, provides real-time conversational assistance for health queries and product searches, improving accessibility for elderly or visually impaired users.

To ensure medical accuracy, the platform integrates a certified doctor consultation module for chat or video-based expert support. For last-mile delivery, especially in remote areas, autonomous drone delivery is incorporated with real-time tracking, ensuring that essential medications reach patients quickly and reliably. This solution not only simplifies healthcare access but also makes it more proactive and responsive.

The backend infrastructure is built using modern, scalable technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, Firebase, and MongoDB. AI models are developed using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV, with lightweight versions deployed using TensorFlow Lite for offline edge capabilities. The system is deployed on cloud platforms like Google Cloud or Azure using Docker and Kubernetes, with monitoring handled through Grafana or Streamlit dashboards.

This repository contains the source code, models, documentation, and deployment configurations for the complete platform. Contributions are welcome to expand the scope and improve the solution further, as we believe in the power of open-source innovation to create real-world impact in healthcare.
